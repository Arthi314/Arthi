### Improved Cross-Dataset Facial Expression Recognition by Handling Data Imbalance and Feature Confusion 
##### _Accepted at [WCPA, ECCV Workshops, 2022](https://sites.google.com/view/wcpa2022/program)_

The objective is to utilize labelled source domain data along with unlabelled target domain data effectively recognize facial expressions in the target domain. Proposed **D**ata **I**mbalance and **F**eature **C**onfusion(DIFC) module to mitigate the effect of class imbalance due to labeled source
domain samples, while also reducing confusion among classes in target domain.

### Similar Class Style Augmentation for Efficient Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning
##### _Under review_

The problem of Cross-domain Few-shot image classification is to recognize new classes given limited labelled training data, which also come from an unseen domain. We propose a label preserving feature augmentation module along with adaptation of BatchNorm layers for learning with less samples.
